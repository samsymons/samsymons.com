Whenever I play with MITM attacks against my devices on the local network, it always feels like I’m just putting together pieces of Lego until I find a combination of software that does what I want.

BetterCap has pretty much put an end to this problem – earlier I ran a MITM attack again my iPhone, modifying HTTP traffic in about a dozen lines of code.
