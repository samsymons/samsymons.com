I was excited to see Apple release the source code of their corecrypto library the other day. It provides implementations of many of the low level crypto primitives used in their other frameworks, like CommonCrypto. Sadly, itâ€™s not truly open source as the license prevents you from using it elsewhere, but being able to audit the code is a step in the right direction.
