_[Peak: Secrets from the New Science of Expertise](http://amzn.com/0544456238)_ is a book studying _deliberate practice_, the act of pushing yourself to learn more about a subject while constantly reviewing your progress and applying feedback.

Many of the examples in the book are of activities that can be easily quantified; playing chess or memorizing numbers, for example. You can graph your progress from day to day, allowing you to spot weaknesses and improve those areas.

As I read Peak, I thought about how it applies to programming. How do you quantify your skill as a programmer? Number of algorithms you understand? Features implemented? Bugs fixed? There isn’t really a metric for it. But, you _do_ know when you are learning something new.

### Avoiding Stagnation

For the last few months, I haven’t made a lot of meaningful progress as a programmer. I read blogs, browse programming books regularly, and work on small side projects when I can, but I haven’t _really_ gone deep on something new for some time now.

There was a period of time where I learned Ruby, Haskell, Rust and Go, while also studying network security and malware analysis. Since then, I have mostly just coasted along, learning new iOS APIs where needed, but not pushed myself beyond that. This is one of the most harmful things to a programmer, and I’m not sure why I fell off the rails. Avoiding stagnation should be priority #1.

### Building a Schedule

_Peak_ has been extremely motivating for me. It was a solid wake-up call that if I want to stay competitive, there needs to be a massive improvement in focus and dedication.

Since I read _Peak_, I began sitting down every day from 6:30 AM until 8 AM to study. For myself, the choice of topic has been C++ and 3D graphics, two topics that I’ve danced around for years but have not spent the time to become truly adept at. C++ is so widely used in the industry, from compilers to operating systems, that it felt foolish to not attempt to master it (if that’s even possible with such a large language). 3D graphics are a way to stay sharp with mathematics while concerning myself with very low level details of programming with C++.

I encourage other programmers reading this to do the same. Pick something you’re interested in, and set aside the time to practice it every single day. **Every single day**. It’ll be tough going, and you won’t be writing amazing code to start, but it will be worth it.
