title: The Path to Haskell Intermediacy

For a while now, my mornings have been devoted to studying Haskell. It's been an enormously rewarding experience, and I highly recommend it to anybody working in software today. These are some of the resources which helped me to understand the core concepts of the language.

_(I say intermediacy because I'm not an expert in Haskell, so I can't make any claims about that.)_

### Escape From the Ivory Tower

Simon Peyton Jones' [talk from Yow! 2011](http://yow.eventer.com/events/1004/talks/1054) should be enough to convince you to learn Haskell. It goes over the history of Haskell, what it is capable of, and why functional programming is beneficial to the world.

I'd already learned a good amount about Haskell before watching this, but I would imagine that it would have had the same effect had I watched it beforehand.

### Learn You a Haskell

[Learn You a Haskell](http://learnyouahaskell.com/chapters) was my first real dive into Haskell. And, just as everybody who has read it says, it's wonderful. It takes you from no experience with functional programming at all to being able to write a non-trivial Haskell program with ease.

Books on advanced programming languages are often depicted as hefty tomes written by guys with even heftier beards. Not so in this case; Learn You a Haskell is a pleasure. Even if you have no interest in Haskell, you owe it to yourself to read it.

### Real World Haskell

Being a language shrouded in academia, Haskell has seen its fair share of dismissals as being not practical enough. [Real World Haskell](http://book.realworldhaskell.org/read/) takes that claim and thoroughly destroys it.

Reading this after making my way through Learn You a Haskell really helped to cement some of the ideas in my brain.

### Aditya Bhargava's Blog

Aditya Bhargava wrote up some fantastic articles on tricky Haskell concepts, my favorite being [Functors, Applicatives, and Monads In Pictures](http://adit.io/posts/2013-04-17-functors,_applicatives,_and_monads_in_pictures.html). These are in the same sort of style as Learn You a Haskell _(read: not boring)_ and explain the topics succinctly.

### Typeclassopedia

The [Typeclassopedia](http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Typeclassopedia) is a tour of the standard type classes in Haskell, from monad to monoid.

It's been useful to refer back to this article while experimenting with the various type classes. It may take a while to understand it all, but having done so will put you in a much better position.

### What I Wish I Knew When Learning Haskell

Stephen Diehl's [coverage of many intermediate/advanced Haskell topics](http://dev.stephendiehl.com/hask/) is very popular, and for good reason. A lot of this is above my head, but I've still gotten a ton of interesting information out of it.
