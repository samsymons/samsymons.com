The folks at Thoughtbot just released version 2 of their playbook, a guide to how they run their company, covering everything from hiring through to test driven development. The [production checklist](http://playbook.thoughtbot.com/#checklist) is really helpful.

Thoughtbot is one of my most respected companies when it comes to open source work. I'd love to see more groups do something like this.
