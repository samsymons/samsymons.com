### [Lessons Learned in Software Development](http://henrikwarne.com/2015/04/16/lessons-learned-in-software-development/)

These *"How to write bug free code in 5 easy steps"* type articles are a dime a dozen, but this one is great. It really helps to step back from a frustrating debugging session and remember the items on this list.

### [Citation Needed](http://exple.tive.org/blarg/2013/10/22/citation-needed/)

A fun article which digs into the real explanation as to why programmers often begin counting at 0. There's not much more to say about it.

### [I made an NES emulator. Here’s what I learned about the original Nintendo.](https://medium.com/@fogleman/i-made-an-nes-emulator-here-s-what-i-learned-about-the-original-nintendo-2e078c9b28fe)

Michael Fogleman's article on NES emulators kicked off days of research into emulators and how they operate. The [code](https://github.com/fogleman/nes) is a worthwhile read on its own.

Growing up as a teenager with an interest in programming, I viewed emulators as holy ground on which only the most revered programmers may tread. If this week has taught me anything, it's that they aren't nearly as frightening as they sound.

### [Writing an Nes Emulator in Go, Part 1](http://nwidger.github.io/blog/post/writing-an-nes-emulator-in-go-part-1/)

A nice supplementary read for the previous article. This post (and the ones following it) explain how NES emulators work at a technical level.

I love this subject not only because emulators are fascinating, but because Go is a solid language which I haven't had enough time to play with yet. If you're looking for an excuse, these articles will do just fine.

### [Four Days of Go](http://www.evanmiller.org/four-days-of-go.html)

Let's keep the Go train rolling. Evan Miller's impressions of Go are a great read – I hadn't really considered the finer details of the `:=` and `=` distinction.

Also, that gopher is an unsettling little bastard.
