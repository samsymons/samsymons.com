There's no better way to learn than by getting your hands dirty, so with that in mind, we're going to create a task manager from the ground up with Sinatra and Backbone.js, along with a host of other useful projects.

Here's an overview of what we'll be working with:

* Postgres for storing data
* RSpec for testing the API
* Marionette for simplifying our JavaScript
* Sass for our stylesheets
* Haml for markup

> If you want to follow along at home, you can get the [finished project on GitHub](https://github.com/samsymons/Tasks).
