Google's new library for building Vim plugins looks fantastic. Check out the [test files](https://github.com/google/maktaba/tree/master/vroom) for quality examples of its features and Vimscript itself.

On a similar note, the free [Learn Vimscript the Hard Way](http://learnvimscriptthehardway.stevelosh.com) ebook is great for those looking to get started with Vim plugin authoring.
