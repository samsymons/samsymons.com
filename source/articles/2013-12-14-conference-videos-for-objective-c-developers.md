Over the last few years, the number of conferences for Objective-C developers has grown like crazy. They are a fantastic way to learn, giving you the opportunity to hear about some topics you may never have encountered before from people who know them inside and out.

Often, these conferences will sell high-quality videos of their talks, or even give them away for free. This list aims to collect videos from some of the best conferences out there.

<div class="badged-header"><h2>WWDC</h2><span class="badge blue">Free</span></div>

WWDC is an obvious but essential addition to the list. The [sessions](https://developer.apple.com/videos/) are extremely well-produced and cover a diverse range of topics (there was even a session on kernel extension development at WWDC '13).

Apple has really raised the bar with their videos in recent years, particularly with availability. It took almost two weeks for session videos from WWDC 2011 to become available. WWDC '13 videos were ready in less than 24 hours after their respective sessions had ended.

You can watch the 2013 session videos from the [free WWDC app on iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/wwdc/id640199958) or download them directly from [Apple's developer videos page](https://developer.apple.com/videos/).

## NSConference

NSConference is the next best thing to WWDC itself (perhaps except [altWWDC](http://altwwdc.com)). The speakers at NSConference are some of the most knowledgable in the business, with some who have been in the Mac software industry since before NeXTSTEP was acquired, and others previously at Apple itself.

The NSConference 5 videos are [available for purchase](http://my.nsconference.com).

<div class="badged-header"><h2>Çingleton</h2><span class="badge blue">Free</span></div>

[The Çingleton sessions](https://vimeo.com/cingleton) focus on the big picture rather than in-depth technical information, but they're still just as interesting. If you have any interest at all in becoming a better software developer in general, check these out.

<div class="badged-header"><h2>360|iDev</h2><span class="badge blue">Free</span></div>

360|iDev, despite the awkward name, has some of my favorite talks on the list. In addition to great technical information, they have a number of sessions covering the business side of development, such as freelancing and customer support.

You can [get the videos from 360|iDev 2013 for free on Vimeo](http://vimeopro.com/360conferences/360idev-2013).

<div class="badged-header"><h2>Swipe</h2><span class="badge blue">Free</span></div>

[Swipe](http://swipeconference.com.au) is one of the newer conferences on the list, but they have had some fantastic speakers so far.

Unfortunately, videos of the latest sessions don't seem to be available, but you can watch their older events [for free on Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/user11941329).

## One More Thing

Another Australian conference, One More Thing balances its sessions between iOS development _and_ design. The videos are of superb quality and absolutely worth watching.

Videos from their past events can [purchased on their website](http://onemorething.com.au/videos/).

<div class="badged-header"><h2>UIKonf</h2><span class="badge blue">Free</span></div>

[UIKonf](http://www.uikonf.com) is a European conference for iOS developers, held annually in the heart of Germany.

The videos from UIKonf 2013 are [available for free](http://2013.uikonf.com/videos.html).

## Objective-Cologne

[Objective-Cologne](http://objcgn.com), another Germany-based conference, offers their 2013 session videos for a small price. Their 2012 sessions can be downloaded for free [from Gumroad](http://gum.co/OC12).

<div class="badged-header"><h2>CocoaHeads</h2><span class="badge blue">Free</span></div>

[CocoaHeads](http://cocoaheads.org) is “a group devoted to discussion of Apple Computer's Cocoa Framework for programming on Mac OS X (including the iPhone)”. They are a fantastic event for anybody who can make it to one (if you can't, [consider starting your own!](http://cocoaheads.org/starting-a-chapter.html)).

I couldn't find a single page containing all of the videos from the different CocoaHeads chapters, but a [search for CocoaHeads on Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/search?q=CocoaHeads) turned up quite a few.

<div class="badged-header"><h2>Seattle Xcoders</h2><span class="badge blue">Free</span></div>

Seattle Xcoders is a regular meeting of Mac and iOS developers from around the Seattle area. Recently, they have begun adding [recordings of some of their speakers](https://vimeo.com/seattlexcoders).

There are only a handful of videos available right now, but this is one to keep an eye on.
