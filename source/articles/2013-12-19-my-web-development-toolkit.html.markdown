Front-end development moves incredibly fast. It seems that every other day there is a new tool or framework that you have to know. Sometimes

This article skips over basic stuff which every web developer should know, like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

If you have do front-end development in any meaningful capacity, you probably won't be anything in this article that is new to you; it's intended for people looking to get their head around the wealth of tools available.

## CoffeeScript

[CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org) is a small language created by Jeremy Ashkenas.

The beauty of CoffeeScript is that it compiles directly to JavaScript, and does a fine job of doing so. Wherever you would use JavaScript in the past, you can use CoffeeScript in its place.

It's got some big names behind it. GitHub's styleguide calls for using CoffeeScript instead of JavaScript, and Rails ships with it as its default.

## Grunt

Grunt is an amazingly useful tool in many different areas. It can check your files for errors, minify your CSS and JavaScript, then run your tests, all without you lifting a finger.

## Bower

For a long time, front-end web developers lacked an easy way to configure and install packages in a consistent way.

[Bower](http://bower.io) is a package manager for web developers. It manages components, which are ["self-contained packages of different kinds of assets, but most often JavaScript"](http://sindresorhus.com/bower-components/).

Much like RubyGems and CocoaPods, Bower takes a list of components (such as jQuery, Angular, or Bootstrap) which your project depends on, then retrieves and installs them automatically.

Package managers are particularly good at helping you stay up to date. Instead of having to regularly check for new versions of the projects you use, Bower does it all for you.

## Sass

CSS, as great as it is, is incredibly slow moving. It can take years for new features to navigate their way through the standardization labyrinth and out into the real world.

This is where Sass steps in. Sass is a stylesheet language built on top of CSS, enhancing it with new and rather powerful features. You can use variables, partials, and inheritance.

Grunt has the ability to compile your Sass files into a single CSS file whenever you make a change.
