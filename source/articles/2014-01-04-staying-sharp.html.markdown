It's vital to be constantly improving. As a programmer, the most important tool you have is the brain. The only way to improve is, quite simply, to learn.

It's too easy to reach a level of skill with which you can go about your work without much trouble. Without constantly throwing yourself into unfamiliar territory, you'll settle on the [OK Plateau](http://www.brainpickings.org/index.php/2013/10/17/ok-plateau/), where you will stagnate and quickly become antiquated.

Fortunately, we live in a fantastic time. We have what those living a century ago could only dream of: unrestricted access to the entire body of human knowledge. Whichever skill you decide to pick up, you will find no shortage of information.

There's no excuse not to learn something.

## Learning New Things

A nice trend of recent years is that high quality education has become increasingly available — for free — through online course providers. Typically, courses are managed and run by existing institutes like MIT and Harvard, giving them a higher quality than what you'd find elsewhere. Here are some of my favorites.

### Udacity

[Udacity](https://www.udacity.com) features courses on everything you need to know as a software developer, including computer science, design, and mathematics. The [Design of Everyday Things course](https://www.udacity.com/course/design101) is a good one, and taught in part by Don Norman.

### Coursera

[Coursera](https://www.coursera.org) offers courses through well-known institutions, like Stanford and Yale. They have courses in all sorts of topics, like law, medicine, and economics.

The [course on cryptography](https://www.coursera.org/course/crypto) is really well done.

### MIT OpenCourseware

MIT's assortment of courses, which number in the thousands, is impressive. Rather than being courses specifically designed for online education, they are recordings and notes from MIT's actual lectures.

Check out their list of [most popular courses](http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/most-visited-courses/).

### Khan Academy

Perhaps the most well known site on the list, Khan Academy focuses on mathematics from basic arithmetic all the way up to calculus and linear algebra, but has videos on topics like physics and chemistry.

Khan Academy is my favorite here. Sal is an astounding teacher, and the exercises are nicely done. The [TED talk he gave on Khan Academy](http://www.ted.com/talks/salman_khan_let_s_use_video_to_reinvent_education.html) is worth watching.

### EdX

EdX is another aggregator of complete courses from existing universities, created by Harvard and MIT. Their courses, and the site itself, are impressive.

EdX has a [demo course](https://www.edx.org/course/edx/edx-edxdemo101-edx-demo-1038) for new students to try out. After that, perhaps try [Harvard's CS50 course](https://www.edx.org/course/harvardx/harvardx-cs50x-introduction-computer-1022) to refresh your knowledge of data structures and algorithms.

### iTunes University

With countless courses on every topic under the sun, iTunes U cannot be left out. The [iOS app](https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/itunes-u/id490217893?mt=8) works well. iTunes U is particularly handy when following along with a course in progress; you'll get push notifications when new lectures and notes are ready.

### The Theoretical Minimum

[The Theorical Minimum](http://theoreticalminimum.com) is a site I unfortunately don't see mentioned often. It offers lectures on introductory physics topics, directed at people without the means to study physics full time at university. Combined with the math lessons from Khan Academy, The Theoretical Minimum is really good.

## Practicing

You cannot expect to learn a skill and retain your knowledge of it for the rest of your life. The less you use a talent, the quicker it will fade.

You should dedicate a small chunk of each day to honing your skills. I like to wake up at 6:30 each day and play around with something new for 45 minutes, be it math, a new programming language, or something entirely different.

Most importantly, regular practice of new and difficult problems will teach you to think differently. You'll have heard the horror stories about developers who [struggle to write an implementation of FizzBuzz](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2007/02/why-cant-programmers-program.html). It's easy to laugh it off; FizzBuzz is comically easy, right? Sure. That's the point of it. Yet people still get caught by it. Don't be one of those people.

### Project Euler

[Project Euler](http://projecteuler.net/) is a site which provides a set of increasingly mind-bending problems for those interested in mathematics and programming. To really learn something, use a functional programming language like Haskell for each of the problems.

### Wolfram Problem Generator

WolframAlpha, Stephen Wolfram's Mathematica-based computation engine, has [recently begun offering a problem generator](http://www.wolframalpha.com/problem-generator/). It creates new practice problems from scratch, providing a step-by-step solution if needed.

It's worth taking a small amount of time each day to solve a few different problems, just to keep your math skills in check.

### Rosetta Code

[Rosetta Code](http://rosettacode.org/) is a collection of different problems solved in as many languages as possible. Try a problem in a language you're learning, then compare the solutions when you're done.

### Code Reading

Reading the code of others is incredily valuable. Find a project you admire, clone it, run it, change things around, and figure out how it all fits together. See how the author solves a particular problem, then think of how you might have done it. For bonus points, try your hand at fixing a few bugs.

Ruby developers should give [Sinatra](https://github.com/sinatra/sinatra) a try. If you're into Objective-C, you'd be hard pressed not to learn something from [AFNetworking](https://github.com/AFNetworking/AFNetworking). For something more low level, fiddle with [Craft](https://github.com/fogleman/Craft), an open source Minecraft clone.

## Start Learning

Every minute you spend on something you don't learn from is a minute you can never spend again. Make it a goal to reach the end of each day having learned something new.

Instead of mindlessly scrolling through Hacker News or refreshing that Twitter feed, find something you're interested in and *learn it*.
